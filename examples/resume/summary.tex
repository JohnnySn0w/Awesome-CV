I am an innovative and results-driven technology professional with a comprehensive background in firmware engineering, data engineering, and fullstack dev, complemented by a strong academic foundation in computer science. With over 5 years of experience, my career has spanned diverse roles where I have excelled in developing and implementing cost-effective solutions, optimizing system performance, and leading projects to successful completion.

At Starling Medical, I played a pivotal role as the sole developer of an IoT medical device's firmware, driving the project from prototype to production and significantly enhancing device reliability and operational efficiency. My tenure at SLB and the Louisiana Tech Research Institute (LTRI) honed my skills in data management, infrastructure engineering, and project leadership, further demonstrating my capability to deliver high-quality services and innovative solutions.

My technical proficiency spans a wide range of tools and technologies, including C, Python, Node.js, and various communication protocols, underpinned by a strong commitment to best practices in software development and project management methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.
